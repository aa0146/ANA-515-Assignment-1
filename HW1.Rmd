## Gun deaths by age

We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below: 

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

## Gun deaths by race
The below distribution shows the distribution of gun deaths by race: 

```{r race-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race)%>%fct_rev())) + geom_bar() + coord_flip()+labs(x="Victim race")
```
